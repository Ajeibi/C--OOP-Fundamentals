# Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals in C#

Welcome to the Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) Fundamentals GitHub repository! This repository serves as a comprehensive resource for learning and understanding the four pillars of OOP - Encapsulation, Inheritance, Polymorphism, and Abstraction - using practical examples in the C# programming language.

## About

Object-Oriented Programming is a fundamental paradigm in software development that allows developers to model real-world entities as objects with properties and behaviors. To grasp the essence of OOP, one needs a strong foundation in its core concepts, which are encapsulated within the four pillars:

1. **Encapsulation**: Learn how to encapsulate data and behavior within objects, protecting data integrity and promoting code modularity.

2. **Inheritance**: Understand how to create hierarchies of classes to enable code reuse and promote the concept of the "is-a" relationship between objects.

3. **Polymorphism**: Explore how to create flexible and extensible code by allowing objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common base class.

4. **Abstraction**: Discover the power of abstraction by creating abstract classes and interfaces to define common contracts for related classes.

## Contents

This repository includes:

- **Code Examples**: A collection of C# code files demonstrating each of the four pillars of OOP with practical, real-world scenarios.
